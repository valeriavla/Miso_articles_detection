# Automatic Misogyny detection in News Articles

## Problem
The media portrays women victims of violence as stigmatized, guilty, untrustworthy, or sexualized. This method of data governance creates a sense of revictimization in the survivors’ or witnesses’ families and fosters another form of violence against women: media violence.

The responsibility of the communication platforms should be to objectively inform the public without attempting to influence their opinions, but so far, the press has been incapable of doing this. For example, Mexican media has stated, in news articles of occurred femicides, comments such as “It was her fault,” “Her parents should have picked her up,” “Surely she set herself on fire,” “Look how she was dressed up that day,” “She might have fallen and bumped her head” 

## Proposal

Train multiple supervised models to classify misogynistic and non-misogynistic texts obtained from news articles from Mexico in Spanish after applying different transforming and modeling techniques to those and analyzing their results. Which will be evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, and a deep understanding of how the classifier detects both subtle and apparent misogyny.
