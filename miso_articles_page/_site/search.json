    "text": "The responsibility of the communication platforms should be to objectively inform the public without attempting to influence their opinions, but so far, the press has been incapable of doing this. For example, Mexican media has stated, in news articles of occurred femicides, comments such as “It was her fault,” “Her parents should have picked her up,” “Surely she set herself on fire,” “Look how she was dressed up that day,” “She might have fallen and bumped her head” [1].\nThe media portrays women victims of violence as stigmatized, guilty, untrustworthy, or sexualized. This method of data governance creates a sense of revictimization in the survivors’ or witnesses’ families and fosters another form of violence against women: media violence.\nAn analysis done by [2] shows that out of 1,300 reports of violence against women published by more than 20 media platforms from Argentina, 897 revictimized the sufferer women. Such approaches present dangerous interpretive frameworks that justify violent acts, perpetrate a misogynistic and discriminative culture, or even jeopardize judicial investigations."

The work aims to do an exploratory analysis of word modeling techniques results for misogyny detection in news articles that revictimize women.\nTo do so, representations that lose semantic representation, such as BoW, will be implemented with techniques to solve problems, i.e., TF-IDF. Models that preserve semantic representation will also be tested, such as BERT and Word2Vec."
