title: " Data collection"
---

This work's main objective is to classify news articles content and label it as misogynystic or not. However, no dataset contains such information; thus, a manual process must be performed to gather all information. 

Manual obtention and labeling lead to a small amount of data, which is not helpful for models that require big datasets to be trained on, such as neural networks.

Since there are multiple datasets containing tweets in Spanish labeled as misogynistic or not, we will solve the problem by utilizing such data to train models and analyze if those are useful for detecting revictimization.

## Tweets collection

Different datasets collected and labeled through multiple works were gathered to have a 10,000 tweets dataset.

## News articles collection

Maria Salguero is a Mexican activist who has collected multiple femicides articles published in Mexico. To have a bast dataset, her set of almost 8 thousand news and a new collection performed through this work with almost 10,000 news, will be labeled.

## Web scrapping

For the manual collection of this project, an exploration of how to obtain news articles with a high possibility of containing revictimization was performed. One of the essential findings is that most of the revictimizing articles describe "controversial" femicide cases. Unfortunately, most media platforms do not cover issues where little information is given. 

The article search was performed with a list of victims' names, and a web scrapping script was developed to collect the news content.
