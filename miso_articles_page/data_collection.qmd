title: " Data collection"
---

This work's main objective is to classify news articles content and label it as misogynystic or not. However, no dataset contains such information; thus, a manual process must be performed to gather all information. 

Manual obtention and labeling lead to a small amount of data, which is not helpful for models that require big datasets to be trained on, such as neural networks.

Since there are multiple datasets containing tweets in Spanish labeled as misogynistic or not, we will solve the problem by utilizing such data to train models and analyze if those are useful for detecting revictimization.

## Tweets collection

Different datasets collected and labeled through multiple works were gathered to have a 10,000 tweets dataset.

## News articles collection

Maria Salguero is a Mexican activist who has collected multiple femicides articles published in Mexico. To have a bast dataset, her set of almost 8 thousand news and a new collection performed through this work with @X news, will be labeled.
